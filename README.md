#  [The Timeline](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/2227374/ACTM/)

This repository documents a **timeline of anarchy clients** — when they were active and any notable details about them.  

The goal is to keep a historical record for reference and for my website.

## How to Contribute

If you notice:
- A client is missing
- Dates are incorrect
- Any other detail needs updating

👉 **Open a GitHub Issue**  
I will review and update the timeline accordingly.   

All contributions and suggestions should go through the issue tracker.

## Structure

- Each client entry includes:
  - Name of the client
  - Approximate active period
  - Notes (if any)
- Timeline is chronological and updated as new clients appear or more info is available.

## Disclaimer

This is a historical reference for the **Anarchy client scene**.  
It is **not** a client download repository, guide, or cheat tutorial.

If you see anything that should be changed or added, **please open an issue**.
